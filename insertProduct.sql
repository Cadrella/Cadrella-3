Its corners are smoothly rounded, evoking a modern yet timeless feel. The frame surrounds a large canvas, centered perfectly at eye level, and softly illuminated by a pair of warm-toned LED sconces above. The contrast between the natural wood and the swirling blues of the canvas makes the art feel alive. Beneath the painting, a slim brass nameplate simply reads: Vincent van Gogh – 1889. The wall itself is painted a soft, matte stone gray, enhancing the dramatic blues and yellows within the artwork, making the entire frame seem like a portal into the dreamscape beyond.')
